# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

  Your answer: A parameter is a placeholder for the argument in any given function. The argument is the value that takes the place of the parameter once it's called. This allows for different data inputs to be allowed into the function. It's not "hard coded."

  Researched answer: A parameter is a variable that's contained in the declaration of a function. Th argument is the actual value that passes through the function.



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: The method takes in only arrays and returns them in another array of the same length. 

  Researched answer: .map() takes in an array and provides a new array with the results of it's given function to each of the arrays containing values. The callback function is a required parameter while it's index and array param are optional. 



3. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: This is when you call on only certain values contained in an object by use of it's keys.

  Researched answer: A javascript feature that extracts properties from objects and bind them to variables. 



4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: A function is a static set of instructions that can be customized by the programmer to fit a projects needs. A method is also a function but is a predefined built in tool that can be readily envoked by the programmer without custom coding. 

  Researched answer: A method is a property of an object that's contains a function. They are stored in the objects properties. While a function can be custom written with a user decided name. They can be written to also contain params for use of future arguments. 



5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: An object is a container for information. It contains methods and functions that can be invoked. A class is a set of blueprints the object needs to follow. The behavior of the infomration inside the object is dictated by the class.

  Researched answer: A class determines how an object will behave and what it contains. It provides the methods that an object should have. 



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer: Hoisting allows functions, variables, and declarations to be safely used in your code before they are declared.
